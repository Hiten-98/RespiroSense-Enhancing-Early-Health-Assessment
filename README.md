# RespiroSense-Enhancing-Early-Health-Assessment

In this project I have worked on Respiratory Sound Database where the goal was to apply Deep Learning Technologies which can help in early diagnosis, objective assessment and Accessibility.
Respiratory sounds are important indicators of respiratory health and respiratory disorders. The sound emitted when a person breathes is directly related to air movement, changes within lung tissue and the position of secretions within the lung. A wheezing sound, for example, is a common sign that a patient has an obstructive airway disease like asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
These sounds can be recorded using digital stethoscopes and other recording techniques. This digital data opens up the possibility of using machine learning to automatically diagnose respiratory disorders like asthma, pneumonia and bronchiolitis, to name a few.
Extensive preprocessing in audio files were done in order to make it suitable to apply deep learning techniques.
Throughout my report I have discuss about the data, preprocessing steps used, insights gained from the data and deep learning techniques used.
